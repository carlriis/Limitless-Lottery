# Limitless Lottery

A simulation game where you are allowed to spend an infinite amount of money on different kinds of lottery tickets. Will you make more than you spend?

# Probability calculations

The calculations that determine how many lottery tickets won out of a certain amount, are calculated using binomial distribution. This is a way of checking the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments. [*more information about binomial distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)

Using this technique improved the performance of the ticket checking calculations to *O(1)*
